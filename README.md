Project Description: Student Grade Calculator
Overview: The Student Grade Calculator is a console-based Java application designed to help students calculate their total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade based on their performance across multiple subjects. This project aims to provide an interactive tool for students to evaluate their academic results easily.

Features:

Dynamic Subject Input:

Users can specify the number of subjects for which they want to enter marks.
Marks Entry:

The application prompts users to enter the marks obtained in each subject, ensuring that the input is within a valid range (0 to 100).
Total Marks Calculation:

The program calculates the total marks obtained across all subjects.
Average Percentage Calculation:

It computes the average percentage based on total marks and the maximum possible marks for the entered subjects.
Grade Determination:

The calculator assigns a grade based on the average percentage, following a standard grading scale.
Input Validation:

The application includes checks for valid input, ensuring that the number of subjects is positive and that marks are within the acceptable range.
User-Friendly Output:

Results are clearly displayed, including total marks, average percentage (formatted to two decimal places), and the final grade.
Technologies Used:

Java (JDK)
Java Standard Library (for Scanner to handle user input)
Target Audience: This project is aimed at students and educators who wish to quickly compute and assess academic performance. It can also serve as a practical exercise for beginner Java programmers to practice user input handling, conditional logic, and basic calculations.

Usage Instructions:

Compile the Java program using a Java Development Kit (JDK).
Run the compiled program in a command-line environment.
Follow the prompts to enter the number of subjects and the marks for each subject.
View the results displayed, including total marks, average percentage, and grade.
Future Enhancements:

Expand the grading scale to include plus and minus grades (e.g., A-, B+).
Add functionality for different weightings for subjects or courses.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user interaction.
Allow users to save and retrieve past results.
